- Animated headlines and micro-interactions with framer-motion.
- Reusable components (Header, Footer, Hero, Services, IndustryGrid, CTA, SEO).
- Tailwind CSS for rapid responsive design.
- Basic SEO meta tags and structured content for indexability.
- Smooth scrolling, accessible forms, and mobile-first design.

Quick start

   npm install

2. Run dev server:
   npm run dev

3. Build production:
   npm run build

Notes & Next steps

- Add analytics (Google Analytics / Plausible) and marketing integrations (CRM, Chat).
- Add server-side email handling or integrate with a marketing API for form submissions.
- Consider automated sitemap and robots generation (next-sitemap) and schema.org markup for rich results.
